Directory Structure
-------------------

This top level README introduces the directory structure of this
challenge. For more information on the challenge, kindly refer to
the documentation posted in the challenge forum.

    data/       Contains the datasets. Refer to section on 'Data Sets' in the
                document.
    scripts/    Contains scripts to validate and diff your result against the
                golden value. Refer to section on 'Submission and Evaluation'
                in the document, which describes the usage of the scripts
                inside this folder.
    serial/     Serial implementation of a possible solution to this problem.
                Refer to section on 'Example Data Sets and Serial
                Implementation' in order to know more about the algorithm used
                in this example implementation. This folder also has a README
                which provides further information on usage.
    team_name/  Contains a reference Makefile to be used while submitting your
                code. It also contains a reference implementation of the timer
                code used to measure the performance of your implementation.
                This is where your implementation goes.
                Refer to section on 'Submission and Evaluation' for more
                details on how to submit.
